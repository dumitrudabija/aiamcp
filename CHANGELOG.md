# Changelog

All notable changes to the AIA Assessment MCP Server project are documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-10

### üõ°Ô∏è Hallucination Prevention

#### Enhanced Tool Descriptions
- **Fixed LLM hallucination issue** where Claude Desktop was inventing information about AIA
- **Root Cause**: Generic tool descriptions lacked sufficient context about Canada's AIA framework
- **Solution**: Enhanced all tool descriptions with explicit Canadian government context

### üìä Completion Percentage Fix

#### Accurate Progress Tracking
- **Fixed completion percentage calculation** to use only scoring questions as denominator
- **Root Cause**: Calculation used all 162 questions instead of 146 scoring questions
- **Solution**: Changed denominator from 162 total questions to 146 scoring questions
- **Impact**: More accurate assessment progress tracking that reflects functional completion

#### Technical Details
- **Scoring questions**: 146 questions that contribute to the AIA risk score
- **Non-scoring questions**: 16 administrative questions (department, phase, etc.)
- **Old calculation**: `(auto_answered / 162) * 100` - included administrative questions
- **New calculation**: `(auto_answered / scoring_questions_count) * 100` - functional questions only
- **Example**: 162 auto-answered questions now shows 111% (162/146) instead of 100% (162/162)

#### Tool Description Improvements
- **assess_project**: Now prefixed with "CANADA'S ALGORITHMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT (AIA)"
- **analyze_project_description**: Added "CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK" prefix
- **get_questions**: Explicitly mentions "Treasury Board Directive" and "NOT generic AI assessment questions"
- **functional_preview**: Emphasizes "Canadian federal compliance"
- **export_assessment_report**: References "Canada's official framework"

#### Prevention Strategies Implemented
- **Explicit Framework Identification**: Every tool clearly identifies the Canadian context
- **Scope Clarification**: Explicitly states what AIA is NOT to prevent confusion
- **Authority References**: Mentions official government sources and Treasury Board Directive
- **Context Repetition**: Reinforces Canadian government context throughout all descriptions
- **Negative Assertions**: Prevents misinterpretation by stating what AIA is NOT

### üìö New Documentation
- **AIA_HALLUCINATION_PREVENTION.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the problem, solution, and best practices
- **Enhanced server docstring**: Added explicit context about Canada's AIA framework
- **Best practices guide**: Recommendations for preventing hallucination in other MCP servers

### ‚úÖ Verification
- **Tested enhanced descriptions**: All 5 tools now display proper Canadian AIA context
- **Validated prevention**: LLM clients receive clear, authoritative context about AIA framework
- **Confirmed accuracy**: Eliminates risk of clients inventing information about AIA

### üéØ Impact
- **Prevents Hallucination**: LLM clients now have clear, authoritative context about what AIA is
- **Reduces Confusion**: Explicit statements about what AIA is NOT prevent misinterpretation
- **Provides Authority**: References to official government sources establish credibility
- **Maintains Accuracy**: Consistent messaging across all tools ensures coherent understanding

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-09

### üîß Critical Fixes

#### Scoring System Fix
- **Fixed critical scoring issue** where all assessments returned 0 points
- **Root Cause**: `selectedOption` indices (0, 1, 2) were not being properly mapped to choice values ("item1-3", "item2-0")
- **Solution**: Implemented proper index-to-value mapping in `_assess_project` method
- **Impact**: Assessments now return accurate risk scores and impact levels

#### Test Results
- **High-Risk Scenario**: 49 points ‚Üí Impact Level IV (Very High Impact) ‚úÖ
- **Low-Risk Scenario**: 5 points ‚Üí Impact Level I (Little to no impact) ‚úÖ

### üöÄ Workflow Enhancements

#### Claude Desktop Integration Improvements
- **Enhanced tool descriptions** with explicit workflow warnings
- **Added workflow guidance** in tool responses to prevent AI assumptions
- **Implemented proper tool sequencing** to ensure accurate assessments

#### Tool Description Updates
- `assess_project`: Added "FINAL STEP" and "CRITICAL" warnings
- `responses` parameter: Marked as "REQUIRED" with clear expectations
- Added explicit warnings against making assumptions about risk levels

#### Automatic Workflow Guidance
- **Without responses**: Shows warning message and step-by-step workflow
- **With responses**: Confirms valid assessment completion
- **Prevents inconsistencies** between AI interpretations and calculated scores

### üìö Documentation Overhaul

#### New Documentation
- `README.md`: Comprehensive project documentation with proper MCP focus
- `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_USAGE_GUIDE.md`: Detailed usage instructions and workflow
- `SCORING_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md`: Technical documentation of the scoring fix
- `CHANGELOG.md`: This changelog file

#### Removed Outdated Files
- `DEMO_CONVERSATION_TEMPLATES.md`: Outdated demo content
- `DEMO_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`: Superseded by comprehensive testing
- `WORKFLOW_GUIDANCE.md`: Consolidated into usage guide
- `SCHEMA_FIXES_LOG.md`: Consolidated into this changelog

### üîÑ Configuration Updates

#### MCP Server Configuration
- **Protocol Version Handling**: Server accepts client's protocol version
- **Working Directory**: Automatic change to script directory for data file access
- **Schema Validation**: Fixed Python boolean syntax (`True`/`False` vs `true`/`false`)
- **Error Handling**: Improved notification handling and response validation

#### Claude Desktop Configuration
- Updated configuration examples for all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Added absolute path requirements and troubleshooting guidance
- Provided working configuration templates

### üß™ Testing Improvements

### üìä Framework Compliance

#### AIA Framework Implementation
- **162 total questions** from official Treasury Board questionnaire
- **4-tier risk classification** (Levels I-IV)
- **Maximum score**: 298 points
- **Proper impact level thresholds**: 0-15, 16-30, 31-50, 51+ points

#### Question Categorization
- **115 technical questions**: Auto-answerable from project descriptions
- **16 impact/risk questions**: Require analysis and reasoning
- **31 manual questions**: Require human stakeholder input
