## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-11

### üö® Critical Fix: Completion Percentage Logic

#### Problem Resolved
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Completion percentages could exceed 100%, reaching impossible values like 135%
- **Root Cause**: System answered all 162 questions but calculated completion using only 109 Design phase questions as denominator
- **Mathematical Error**: 147 answered questions √∑ 109 Design phase questions = 135% completion
- **User Impact**: Confusing and mathematically impossible progress indicators

#### Solution Implemented
- **Design Phase Question Filtering**: All MCP tools now consistently use only the 116 Design phase questions
- **Accurate Completion Calculation**: `(auto_responses / design_phase_questions) * 100` ensures ‚â§100%
- **Survey Analysis**: Identified 4 Implementation-only pages that should be excluded for Design phase users
- **Systematic Fix**: Updated all 8 MCP tool methods for consistent filtering logic

#### Technical Details
- **Total Questions in Survey**: 162 questions
- **Design Phase Questions**: 116 questions (filtered based on visibility conditions)
- **Implementation-Only Pages Excluded**: 4 pages
  - `consultationImplementation`
  - `dataQualityImplementation` 
  - `fairnessImplementation`
  - `privacyImplementation`
- **Filtering Logic**: Based on `{projectDetailsPhase} = "item1"` vs `{projectDetailsPhase} = "item2"` conditions

#### Methods Updated for Consistency
- ‚úÖ `_analyze_project_description()` - Fixed completion percentage calculation
- ‚úÖ `_assess_project()` - Uses Design phase questions for response validation
- ‚úÖ `_get_questions()` - Returns only Design phase questions, updated framework_info
- ‚úÖ `_get_questions_summary()` - Calculates summary based on Design phase questions
- ‚úÖ `_get_questions_by_category()` - Filters categories using Design phase questions
- ‚úÖ `_calculate_assessment_score()` - Uses Design phase questions for max score
- ‚úÖ `_export_assessment_report()` - Uses Design phase questions for max score in reports
- ‚úÖ `_functional_preview()` - Maintains consistency with Design phase filtering

#### Verification Results
- **Completion Percentage Test**: ‚úÖ Now shows 100% maximum (was 135%)
- **Question Count Verification**: ‚úÖ All tools report 116 Design phase questions consistently
- **End-to-End Testing**: ‚úÖ All MCP tools use consistent filtering logic
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: ‚úÖ Completion percentage mathematically impossible to exceed 100%

#### Impact
- **User Experience**: Eliminates confusing >100% completion percentages

- **Fixed LLM hallucination issue** where Claude Desktop was inventing information about AIA
- **Root Cause**: Generic tool descriptions lacked sufficient context about Canada's AIA framework
- **Solution**: Enhanced all tool descriptions with explicit Canadian government context

### üìä Completion Percentage Fix

#### Phase-Specific Progress Tracking
- **Fixed completion percentage calculation** to use Design phase scoring questions as denominator
- **Root Cause**: Calculation used all 146 scoring questions, but users only see phase-specific questions
- **Discovery**: AIA questionnaire shows different questions based on project phase (Design vs Implementation)
- **Solution**: Changed denominator from 146 total scoring questions to 109 Design phase scoring questions

#### Technical Details
- **Design phase scoring questions**: 109 (55 always-visible + 54 design-only)
- **Implementation phase scoring questions**: 92 (55 always-visible + 37 implementation-only)
- **Non-scoring questions**: 16 administrative questions (department, phase, etc.)
- **Phase-specific calculation**: `(auto_answered / 109) * 100` for Design phase users
- **Previous calculation**: `(auto_answered / 146) * 100` - used all scoring questions regardless of phase
- **Example**: 162 auto-answered questions now shows 149% (162/109) vs 111% (162/146)

#### Impact
- **More accurate progress tracking** that reflects questions actually visible to users
- **Design phase focus** since most initial assessments are done during project design
- **Better user experience** with completion percentages that match visible question count
