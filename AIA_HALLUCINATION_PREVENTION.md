# AIA Hallucination Prevention Documentation

## Problem Identified

When Claude Desktop was asked about AI assessment tools, it provided hallucinated information about AIA (Algorithmic Impact Assessment), potentially making up details about what AIA stands for or its scope. This is a common issue with LLMs when they lack proper context about specialized frameworks.

## Root Cause

The original MCP server tool descriptions were generic and didn't provide sufficient context about what AIA specifically refers to. This allowed LLM clients to:
- Confabulate or invent information about AIA
- Assume AIA was a generic AI assessment tool
- Make up details about the framework's scope and purpose

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Server Documentation

Updated the main server docstring with explicit context:

```python
"""
AIA Assessment MCP Server
A Model Context Protocol server for Canada's Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA)

IMPORTANT: AIA refers specifically to Canada's Algorithmic Impact Assessment framework,
a mandatory assessment tool for Canadian federal government institutions to evaluate
the impact of automated decision systems. This is NOT a generic AI assessment tool.

Framework Details:
- Official Government of Canada requirement (Treasury Board Directive)
- Applies to automated decision systems used by federal institutions
- Measures impact on rights, health, economic interests, and environment
- Results in Impact Levels I-IV with corresponding mitigation requirements
- Based on specific questionnaire with 48+ questions across 8 categories
"""
```

### 2. Enhanced Tool Descriptions

All 5 MCP tools now have explicit Canadian AIA context in their descriptions:

#### assess_project
- **Before**: "FINAL STEP: Calculate official AIA risk score..."
- **After**: "CANADA'S ALGORITHMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT (AIA) - FINAL STEP: Calculate official AIA risk score using actual question responses. CRITICAL: AIA is Canada's mandatory government framework for automated decision systems - NOT a generic AI assessment..."

#### analyze_project_description
- **Before**: "Intelligently analyze a project description to automatically answer AIA questions..."
- **After**: "CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Intelligently analyze a project description to automatically answer Canada's Algorithmic Impact Assessment questions where possible... AIA is Canada's mandatory government framework - NOT a generic AI assessment."

#### get_questions
- **Before**: "Get AIA questions by category or type"
- **After**: "CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Get Canada's Algorithmic Impact Assessment questions by category or type. These are official government questions from Canada's Treasury Board Directive - NOT generic AI assessment questions."

#### functional_preview
- **Before**: "Early functional risk assessment for AI projects..."
- **After**: "CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Early functional risk assessment for AI projects using Canada's Algorithmic Impact Assessment framework. Focuses on technical characteristics and planning insights for Canadian federal compliance..."

#### export_assessment_report
- **Before**: "Export AIA assessment results to a Microsoft Word document..."
- **After**: "CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Export Canada's Algorithmic Impact Assessment results to a Microsoft Word document. Creates a professional AIA compliance report... based on Canada's official framework."

### 3. Key Prevention Strategies

1. **Explicit Framework Identification**: Every tool description starts with "CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK" or similar
2. **Scope Clarification**: Explicitly states this is NOT a generic AI assessment
3. **Authority Reference**: References Treasury Board Directive and Government of Canada
4. **Context Repetition**: Reinforces the Canadian government context throughout
5. **Negative Assertions**: Explicitly states what AIA is NOT to prevent confusion

## Verification

Tested the enhanced descriptions with a tools/list request:

```
âœ… MCP Server Test Results:
Found 5 tools with enhanced descriptions:

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ assess_project: CANADA'S ALGORITHMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT (AIA) - FINAL STEP...
ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ analyze_project_description: CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Intelligently analyze...
ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ get_questions: CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Get Canada's Algorithmic Impact...
ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ functional_preview: CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Early functional risk assessment...
ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ export_assessment_report: CANADA'S AIA FRAMEWORK: Export Canada's Algorithmic...
```

All tools now have the ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ indicator showing they contain proper Canadian AIA context.

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Hallucination**: LLM clients now have clear, authoritative context about what AIA is
2. **Reduces Confusion**: Explicit statements about what AIA is NOT prevent misinterpretation
3. **Provides Authority**: References to official government sources establish credibility
4. **Maintains Accuracy**: Consistent messaging across all tools ensures coherent understanding

## Best Practices for MCP Servers

Based on this implementation, here are recommendations for preventing hallucination in MCP servers:

1. **Be Explicit**: Don't assume LLMs know what specialized acronyms or frameworks mean
2. **Provide Context**: Include authoritative sources and official references
3. **Use Negative Assertions**: Explicitly state what something is NOT to prevent confusion
4. **Repeat Key Information**: Reinforce important context across multiple tool descriptions
5. **Reference Authority**: Mention official sources, government directives, or standards
6. **Test with Clients**: Verify that LLM clients receive and understand the context correctly

## Impact

This enhancement significantly reduces the risk of LLM clients hallucinating or inventing information about Canada's AIA framework, ensuring that users receive accurate, authoritative information about this specific government compliance requirement.
