# OSFI E-23 Compliance Guidance: Preventing AI Hallucination in Risk Assessments

## ⚠️ CRITICAL COMPLIANCE WARNING

**OSFI E-23 model risk assessments must be based on factual analysis, not AI-generated content. This guidance ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.**

## 1. Risk Assessment Integrity Framework

### 1.1 Input Validation Requirements
- **Project descriptions must be factual and verifiable**
- All technical specifications must be documented and validated
- Business rationale must be supported by actual business requirements
- Data sources and methodologies must be explicitly documented

### 1.2 Assessment Methodology Transparency
- Risk scoring is based on **explicit, documented criteria** (not AI interpretation)
- All risk factors are mapped to **specific, verifiable project characteristics**
- Risk amplification rules are **predetermined and documented**
- No subjective AI interpretation of risk levels

## 2. Safeguards Against AI Hallucination

### 2.1 Structured Input Requirements
The system requires users to provide:
```
✅ REQUIRED: Factual project description with:
   - Specific technical architecture details
   - Documented data sources and volumes
   - Explicit business use cases
   - Defined decision-making processes
   - Measurable performance criteria

❌ AVOID: Vague descriptions that require AI interpretation
```

### 2.2 Risk Factor Detection Logic
The system uses **rule-based detection** (not AI interpretation):
```python
# Example: Financial Impact Detection
financial_impact = any(term in description_lower for term in [
    'loan', 'credit', 'pricing', 'capital', 'risk management'
])
# This is FACTUAL KEYWORD MATCHING, not AI interpretation
```

### 2.3 Transparent Scoring Methodology
```
Risk Score = Quantitative Factors + Qualitative Factors × Amplification
- Quantitative: Based on documented volumes, impacts, criticality
- Qualitative: Based on documented technology choices, processes
- Amplification: Predetermined rules for risk combinations
```

## 3. User Responsibility Framework

### 3.1 Input Accuracy Responsibility
**Users must ensure:**
- All project descriptions are factually accurate
- Technical details reflect actual system design
- Business impact statements are validated
- Regulatory requirements are correctly identified

### 3.2 Review and Validation Process
**Before using any assessment:**
1. **Verify all input data is accurate and complete**
2. **Review risk factor identification for accuracy**
3. **Validate that detected characteristics match actual project**
4. **Confirm risk score reflects actual project risk profile**
5. **Have qualified personnel review all assessments**

## 4. Report Generation Safeguards

### 4.1 Template-Based Generation
Reports use **structured templates** with:
- Predetermined section structures
- Factual data insertion (not AI generation)
- Standard compliance language
- Required regulatory disclaimers

### 4.2 Content Validation Requirements
**Every generated report must be:**
- Reviewed by qualified model risk professionals
- Validated against actual project characteristics
- Approved by appropriate governance authority
- Documented with review trail

## 5. Compliance Checklist

### 5.1 Before Assessment
- [ ] Project description is factually accurate and complete
- [ ] All technical specifications are documented

- [ ] Data sources and volumes are confirmed
- [ ] Decision-making processes are explicitly defined

### 5.2 During Assessment
- [ ] Risk factor detection matches actual project characteristics
- [ ] Risk score reflects documented project attributes
- [ ] No subjective AI interpretation is applied
- [ ] All scoring logic is transparent and auditable

### 5.3 After Assessment
- [ ] Results reviewed by qualified personnel
- [ ] Risk rating validated against actual project risk
- [ ] Governance requirements appropriate for actual risk level
- [ ] Report content factually accurate
- [ ] Appropriate approvals obtained

## 6. Regulatory Compliance Framework

### 6.1 OSFI E-23 Requirements
- Model risk assessments must be **objective and evidence-based**
- Risk ratings must reflect **actual model characteristics**
- Governance requirements must be **appropriate to actual risk**
- Documentation must be **accurate and complete**

### 6.2 Audit Trail Requirements
**Maintain documentation of:**
- Input data sources and validation
- Risk assessment methodology applied
- Review and approval processes
- Any modifications or overrides applied

## 7. Professional Oversight Requirements

### 7.1 Qualified Personnel
**All assessments must be:**
- Conducted by qualified model risk professionals
- Reviewed by independent validation teams
- Approved by appropriate governance authorities
- Supported by documented expertise

### 7.2 Governance Oversight
**Institutional requirements:**
- Model Risk Committee oversight
- Senior management accountability
- Board-level approval for Critical models
- Regular audit and validation processes

## 8. Disclaimer and Limitations

### 8.1 Tool Limitations
**This tool provides:**
- ✅ Structured assessment framework
- ✅ Consistent risk evaluation methodology
- ✅ Standardized documentation templates
- ✅ Compliance checklist guidance

**This tool does NOT provide:**
- ❌ Final risk determinations (requires human validation)
- ❌ Regulatory compliance certification
- ❌ Substitute for professional judgment
- ❌ Automated approval decisions

### 8.2 User Responsibilities
**Users are responsible for:**
- Ensuring input accuracy and completeness
- Validating assessment results
- Obtaining appropriate approvals
- Maintaining compliance with OSFI E-23
- Professional oversight and governance

## 9. Best Practices for Claude Desktop Usage

### 9.1 Input Preparation
```
GOOD: "Credit risk model using logistic regression on 50,000 customer records 
       with 25 documented variables including income, credit history, and 
       employment status. Processes 1,000 applications daily with automated 
       approval for scores >700, manual review for 600-700, automatic 
       rejection <600."

BAD:  "AI system for credit decisions that uses machine learning."
```

### 9.2 Result Validation
**Always verify:**
- Risk factors match actual project characteristics
- Risk score reflects documented project attributes
- Governance requirements are appropriate
- Report content is factually accurate

### 9.3 Professional Review
**Every assessment requires:**
- Review by qualified model risk professional
- Validation against actual project documentation
- Approval by appropriate governance authority
- Documentation of review process

## 10. Emergency Procedures

### 10.1 If Assessment Appears Inaccurate
1. **STOP** - Do not use the assessment
2. **REVIEW** - Check input data for accuracy
3. **VALIDATE** - Confirm project characteristics
4. **ESCALATE** - Engage qualified personnel
5. **DOCUMENT** - Record issues and resolution

### 10.2 Regulatory Inquiry Response
**If questioned by regulators:**
- Provide complete audit trail
- Demonstrate input validation process
- Show professional review documentation
- Explain methodology transparency
- Confirm human oversight and approval
